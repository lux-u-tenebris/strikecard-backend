    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan#Modern_plan

    Telephone numbers have the following form: NXX-NXX-XXXX per the "North
    American Numbering Plan"

    - Exactly 10 digits
    - N must be 2-9
    - X may be 0-9 with some exceptions.

    Additional rules:

    - First NXX is the area code.
        - Reserved and non-geographic codes.
            - NXX where the two X are identical, reserved for non-geographic
                use. 911, 988, 800, etc.
            - N90-N99 are reserved for expansion.
            - 370-379, 960-969 are reserved for expansion.
            - 880-889 are reserved for toll-free use.
            - 950 is reserved for usage of prepaid calling cards.
            - 958, 959 are reserved for system testing.
    - Second NXX is the prefix (or exchange).
        - Prefixes of the form N11 were reserved for "Easily Recognizable
            Codes" during the transition to the modern plan and, while we must
            dial with 10 digits now, this rule has stuck around.
        - Prefix 555 has a block of line numbers reserved for fictional use.
            Only two line numbers (1212, 4334) are currently in use, the
            others are reserved until a need is approved by the Industry
            Numbering Committee:
            https://www.nanpa.com/numbering/555-line-numbers. We can reject
            any of these numbers at this time.
    - XXXX is the line number. There are no restrictions.
